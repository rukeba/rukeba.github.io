    [G D Am7 Am7 | G D C C]

    G                 D            Am7
     Mama, take this badge off of me
    G        D          C 
     I can't use it anymore.
    G              D                        Am7
     It's gettin' dark, too dark for me to see
    G                  D                   C
     I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

    G                D                   Am7
     Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
    G                D                   C
     Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
    Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
    Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

    Mama, put my guns in the ground
    I can't shoot them anymore.
    That long black cloud is comin' down
    I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

    Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
    Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
    Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
    Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

1973
