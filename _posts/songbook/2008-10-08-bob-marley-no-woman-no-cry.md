	[C  G/H  Am7  F  C  F  C  G]
	
	C    G/H          Am  F
	  No woman, no cry,
	C     F          C  G
	  No woman, no cry,
	C    G/H         Am  F
	  No woman, no cry,
	C     F          C G
	  No woman, no cry.
	
	Said, said,
	C        G/H      Am                  F
	  Said I remember when we used to sit
	C              G/H           Am          F
	  In the government yard in Trenchtown.
	C         G/H          Am       F
	  Oba, Observing the hypocrites
	             C         G/H                     Am      F
	As they would mingle   with the good people we meet,
	C            G/H         Am                     F
	  Good friends we had oh good friends we've lost
	C  G/H        Am  F
	  along the way.
	C               G/H        Am               F
	  In this bright future you can't forget your past
	C              G/B      Am     F
	  So dry your  tears I     say   And
	
	No, woman, no cry,
	No, woman, no cry,
	ere, little darlin, dont shed no tears:
	No, woman, no cry.
	
	Said, said,
	Said I remember when-a we used to sit
	In the government yard in trenchtown.
	And then Georgie would make the fire lights,
	As it was logwood burnin through the nights.
	Then we would cook cornmeal porridge,
	Of which Ill share with you;
	My feet is my only carriage,
	So Ive got to push on through.
	But while Im gone, I mean:
	
	C                   G/H         Am                 Fm   G
	 Everythings gonna be alright!  Everythings gonna be alright!
	C                   G/H         Am                Fm   G
	 Everythings gonna be alright!  Everythings gonna be alright!
	Everythings gonna be all right! Everythings gonna be all right!
	Everythings gonna be all right! Everythings gonna be all right!
	
	So, woman, no cry;
	No - no, woman - woman, no cry.
	Woman, little sister, dont shed no tears;
	No, woman, no cry.
