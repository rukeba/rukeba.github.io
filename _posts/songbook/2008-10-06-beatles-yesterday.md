	F
	Yesterday,
	Em7          A7                Dm      Dm7 B
	   All my troubles seemed so far away
	        C7                      F
	Now it looks as though they're here to stay
	C   Dm7   G7
	Oh, I  believe
	    B     F
	In yesterday
	
	Suddenly
	I'm not half the man I used to be
	There's a shadow hanging over me
	Oh, yesterday
	Came suddenly
	
	 A7sus   A7
	Why    she
	 Dm  C  B Dm        Gm6
	Had to go I don't know
	     C7          F
	She wouldn't say
	A7sus  A7
	I     said
	 Dm   C     B    Dm    Gm6
	Something wrong now I long
	     C7    F
	For yesterday
	
	Yesterday
	Love was such an easy game to play
	Now I need a place to hide away
	Oh, I believe
	In yesterday
	
	Why she
	Had to go I don't know
	She wouldn't say
	I said
	Something wrong now I long
	For yesterday
	
	Yesterday
	Love was such an easy game to play
	Now I need a place to hide away
	Oh, I believe
	   C7     F
	In yesterday
	      G7    B  F
	Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
